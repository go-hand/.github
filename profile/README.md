Hello ðŸ‘‹. I'm not an application developer, but I enjoy writing small to medium-sized programs (scripts). I started using Go in 2018â€”after working with Bash, Perl, and Pythonâ€”for tools, automation, security, and integration tasks. I havenâ€™t looked back since. I created this organization to share what Iâ€™ve learned. I hope others find it usefulâ€”and maybe even contribute.
