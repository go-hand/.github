Hello ðŸ‘‹. I'm not an application developer but I enjoy writing programs. I started using Go in 2018â€”after using Bash, Perl and Pythonâ€”for tools, automation, security and integration tasks. I havenâ€™t looked back since. I created this organization to share what Iâ€™ve learned. I hope others find it useful and maybe even contribute.

Contents (so far)

* [From Bash to Go](https://github.com/go-hand/from-bash-to-go) - Code and accompanying text for a sample health check tool that started in Bash and continued in Go.
* [Dot file hiding file server](https://github.com/go-hand/dot-file-hiding-file-server) - A dialogue on Go interface embedding :-)
